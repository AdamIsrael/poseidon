Python API Digital Ocean (v2)

The DigitalOcean API allows you to manage Droplets and resources within the
DigitalOcean cloud in a simple, programmatic way using conventional HTTP
requests. The endpoints are intuitive and powerful, allowing you to easily make
calls to retrieve information or to execute actions.

All of the functionality that you are familiar with in the DigitalOcean control
panel is also available through the API, allowing you to script the complex
actions that your situation requires.
